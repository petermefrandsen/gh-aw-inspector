# GH AW Inspector

**GH AW Inspector** is a VS Code extension designed to interface with any agentic / AI CLI, specifically tailored to inspect and interact with the `gh-aw` (Agentic Workflows) CLI.

## Motivation & Features
- **Sidebar Commands**: Quickly execute common `gh-aw` CLI commands (e.g., listing current agentic workflows).
- **Simulate Outputs**: Execute predefined prompts against specific workflows (selected via a dropdown) and simulate their output. 
- **Auto-generated Markdown**: Output simulation is structured elegantly into Markdown with:
  - Description
  - Metadata
  - Prerequisites
  - Intent
  - Example happy path output
  - Example(s) unhappy path outputs

## Development & Setup
Please see [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for how to get started locally. 

*Note: The core extension logic is still pending implementation.*
